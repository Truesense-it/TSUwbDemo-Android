# Trusense UWB DEMO APP for Android
This repository contains the source code for interfacing UWB-enabled Android phones with Truesense's [UWB Development Kit](https://ultrawideband.truesense.it) running Truesense ATIF firmware.

## BUILDING
Open the project in Android Studio and build.
Make sure that you run the app on a phone that supports UWB technology [Listed here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UWB-enabled_mobile_devices)
Also make sure that UWB is enabled (usually in the Settings->Connectivity menu of the smartphone)

## TODO
- manage multiple sessions in parallel
- better handling of disconnections on BLE side
- further testing with the recent alpha06 UWB Jetpack library
- add fancy graphics
- test on more smartphone models
